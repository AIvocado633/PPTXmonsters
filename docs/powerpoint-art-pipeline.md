# Drawing the monsters in PowerPoint

Every character in this game — the player and the features they are fighting —
is drawn in PowerPoint and exported as PNG. That is the joke, and it is also a
hard constraint: if a sprite could not have been built out of autoshapes, it
does not belong in the game.

This document is the contract between the deck and the code.

## Where things live

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Source decks | `art/*.pptx` (not created yet — add them as you draw) |
| Exported frames | `assets/images/` |
| Loader | [`lib/game/art/pptx_art.dart`](../lib/game/art/pptx_art.dart) |
| Component that draws an actor | [`lib/game/components/pptx_actor.dart`](../lib/game/components/pptx_actor.dart) |

## Naming

Frames are a zero-padded sequence sharing a prefix:

```
assets/images/hero_idle_000.png
assets/images/hero_idle_001.png
assets/images/hero_idle_002.png
```

`PptxArt.loadAnimation('hero_idle_')` loads `000`, `001`, … and stops at the
first missing number. A single still is just a one-frame sequence.

The prefix is `<actor>_<state>_`. Actors in use so far are `hero`,
`autofit` and `smartart` -- the last is a single SmartArt shape, drawn once
and repeated for every node in the diagram. States in use so far:

- `idle` — standing still, the only one the menu needs
- `walk` — planned, for the arena
- `hit`, `die` — planned

## Drawing rules

- **One pose per slide.** Slide 1 is frame `000`, slide 2 is frame `001`, and
  so on. Keep each animation in its own deck.
- **Keep the character the same size and in the same place on every slide**, or
  it will jitter when the frames play. Use *View ▸ Guides* and leave the
  character's feet on the same guide in every pose.
- **Draw at roughly 512×512.** Sprites are scaled down in game, so exporting
  larger than you need costs nothing but a few KB and keeps them crisp on
  high-DPI phones.
- **Group each pose** (select everything on the slide, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>).
  Export needs one shape per slide, and grouping also stops you nudging a leg
  out of place by accident.

## Exporting with a transparent background

This is the step that goes wrong. *File ▸ Export ▸ PNG* exports whole slides,
background included, which gives you a white box around every monster.

Instead, export the shape:

1. Select the grouped pose on the slide.
2. Right-click ▸ **Save as Picture…**
3. Choose **PNG**, name it `hero_idle_000.png`, save into `assets/images/`.

PowerPoint writes the shape's own bounds with a transparent background.

### Doing it in bulk

For anything longer than a few frames, a macro beats clicking. Open the deck,
press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F11</kbd>, insert a module and adapt:

```vb
' Assumes exactly one (grouped) shape per slide.
Sub ExportFrames()
    Const Prefix As String = "hero_idle_"
    Const Folder As String = "C:\path\to\PPTXmonsters\assets\images\"
    Dim sld As Slide
    For Each sld In ActivePresentation.Slides
        sld.Shapes(1).Export _
            Folder & Prefix & Format(sld.SlideIndex - 1, "000") & ".png", _
            ppShapeFormatPNG, 512, 512
    Next sld
End Sub
```

Treat this as a starting point rather than a tested script — check the first
few files it writes before trusting a whole run, and note that the deck must be
saved as `.pptm` for the macro to persist.

## Using the art in game

Drop the PNGs into `assets/images/` and restart the app (a hot *reload* will not
pick up new assets; hot *restart* or a full run will). Nothing else is needed:
`assets/images/` is registered wholesale in `pubspec.yaml`, and `PptxActor`
looks its frames up by prefix.

```dart
PptxActor(
  artPrefix: 'hero_idle_',
  size: Vector2.all(230),
)
```

### Until the art exists

`PptxActor` falls back to a procedural stand-in — a monster made of the same
autoshapes the real art will be made of — so pages stay laid out and animated
while the deck is still being drawn. You will see one line per missing actor in
the console:

```
PptxArt: no frames named "hero_idle_000.png" in assets/images/ - falling back to placeholder art.
```

That message disappears on its own once the frames are in place.

## Adding a new monster

1. Draw it in a new deck, one pose per slide.
2. Export as `<actor>_idle_000.png`, … into `assets/images/`.
3. Add a `PptxActor(artPrefix: '<actor>_idle_')` where you want it.
4. If it is a boss, set its slide's `buildBoss` in `kLevels`, in
   [`lib/game/levels.dart`](../lib/game/levels.dart), to its constructor. The
   arena needs no changes.
