# PPTX Monsters

[![CI](https://github.com/AIvocado633/PPTXmonsters/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AIvocado633/PPTXmonsters/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A 2D mobile game about defeating the PowerPoint features that defeated you.

Each level is a slide. Each boss is a feature — AutoFit, SmartArt, the Slide
Master, the Animation Pane. You fight them from a top-down view inside the
slide, with a character drawn in PowerPoint.

Built with Flutter and the [Flame](https://flame-engine.org) engine.

## Status

Slides 1 and 2 are playable end to end. The other four bosses are named but
not built.

- **Start menu** — a title slide in PowerPoint's normal editing view, with
  ribbon, status bar, dashed placeholders and staggered "Fly In" entrances.
- **Slide sorter** — level select, showing all six slides (see *Progression*
  below).
- **Slide show** — two fights so far, AutoFit and SmartArt, with twin-stick
  controls (see below).
- **Design Ideas** — a settings pane with nothing wired up yet.

### Progression

The deck is played in order. Slide 1 is always open; every other slide opens
once the one before it is won, and stays open, because wins are saved on the
device. Any slide you have opened can be replayed.

- **Slide sorter** — each thumbnail shows where its slide stands: a star
  under a slide you have beaten (the mark PowerPoint gives slides with
  animations), a plain slide when it is open, a greyed-out slide with a bolt
  when it is locked, and a faded *hidden slide*, number struck through, when
  its boss has not been built yet.
- **Winning** a slide offers **Next Slide** first, then Retry Slide and End
  Show. Beating the last slide that has been built ends on the same dialog
  without Next Slide, until the rest of the deck exists.
- **Start menu** — *Start Slide Show* (F5) on a fresh deck. Once you have won
  something it becomes *From Current Slide* (Shift+F5) and opens the first
  slide you have not won yet, which is also the slide the status bar shows.
  The footer counts down the features still in the way.

### Controls

Twin-stick: one input moves, the other aims, and pushing the aim in any
direction fires that way immediately — there is no fire button.

|           | Touch             | Keyboard                         | Controller          |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Move**  | left thumb stick  | WASD                             | left stick          |
| **Aim**   | right thumb stick | arrow keys                       | right stick         |
| **Menus** | tap               | arrows, Enter or Space, Esc      | D-pad or left stick, A, B |
| **Pause** | Pause chip        | B or `.`                         | Start               |

All three work at once, so you can pick up a controller mid-fight.

Menus work without touching the screen. Arrows, the D-pad or the left stick
move focus, drawn as a PowerPoint selection; the slide sorter moves across its
grid. Enter, Space or A chooses, and Esc or B goes back. On the start menu,
F5 starts the show from the beginning and Shift+F5 from the current slide, as
in PowerPoint. Mid-fight, Esc or B opens the pause menu (see below). On
Android the back gesture goes back a step — during a fight it pauses instead —
and only leaves the app from the title slide.

### Pausing

During a real slide show, **B** blanks the screen until you press it again, so
that is what pausing looks like: the fight freezes behind a black slide
offering Resume, Retry Slide and End Show. `.`, controller **Start** and the
**Pause** chip do the same.

Nothing advances while paused — movement, shot cooldowns, boss timers and
shots already in the air all stop together, because the whole board is one
frozen time scale — and resuming never fires a shot queued behind the menu.

Leaving a fight takes two steps now: Esc, back or the **End Show** chip opens
the pause menu with End Show already chosen, so one stray tap or key press
cannot lose a fight. Pressing Esc again ends it, as in PowerPoint.

The fight also pauses itself when the app goes away — a notification, a call,
another app, or a desktop window losing focus — and stays paused on the way
back, so nobody returns mid-dodge. Space still
fires along the way you are walking, for anyone who would rather not aim.
Controllers come through the Flame team's
[`gamepads`](https://pub.dev/packages/gamepads) package, whose normalized
events map every platform's pad onto the same Xbox-style layout.

Each fight is built out of the feature's own behaviour rather than out of a
health bar with a new sprite on it.

### Slide 1 — AutoFit

AutoFit shrinks whatever does not fit, so the fight turns that on both sides.
Every hit the boss lands makes the player smaller; every bullet point that
lands steps the boss down the same ladder of point sizes PowerPoint walks when
AutoFit kicks in, from 54 pt to nothing. Whoever runs out of size first loses
the slide.

Shrinking is not purely a punishment. A smaller player is quicker and a
narrower target, and can squeeze closer to the walls — the trade is that you
have less room left to lose.

### Slide 2 — SmartArt

SmartArt is not one target but six connected shapes. Break one and the
survivors immediately re-lay themselves out into the next layout — cycle,
process, hierarchy, pyramid — closing ranks and throwing your aim away, which
is exactly what SmartArt does to a slide the moment you add or remove a line.
It fights back by throwing its connector arrows at you.

Where AutoFit is one target that gets smaller, SmartArt is many targets that
keep moving: same controls, a completely different problem.

### How a hit feels

A hit is never just a number going down. Whatever was hit flashes and squashes,
the board shakes when the player takes one, and what the hit cost floats off it
in that side's own units — `−6 pt` off AutoFit, `−1 shape` off SmartArt, `−13%`
off the player. Health is never a bar in this game, so the numbers say what the
readouts say.

After a hit the player is briefly untouchable, blinking, so two shots arriving
together cost one size rather than two. Both bosses fire slower than that
window, so it only ever swallows shots that arrive at once; a test holds them
to that. Bosses get no such mercy: every bullet point in a stream counts.

Losing plays a PowerPoint *exit* animation — Shrink & Turn — and the result
dialog waits for it to finish. A boss beaten during those last moments does
not steal the win.

Every flash, squash and shake goes through `lib/game/combat/impact.dart`, so
Reduce Motion (#13) can turn them all off from one switch. Damage numbers stay:
they are what happened, not decoration.

## Running it

```bash
flutter run
```

On Windows there is also a script that builds a standalone copy and starts it,
the way a player would launch the game rather than a developer:

```bat
run-windows.bat
```

With no argument it makes a release build; pass `debug` or `profile` for the
other configurations. Double-clicking it works, and the game keeps running
after the console window closes. For a hot-reload loop use `flutter run -d
windows` instead.

Progress is saved on the device as soon as a slide is won. On Windows it lives
in `%APPDATA%\com.pptxmonsters\pptx_monsters\shared_preferences.json`; delete
that file to start the deck over.

To work on a boss without playing through the deck first, open every built
slide with a developer switch:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=UNLOCK_ALL=true
```

It changes what is open, never what is saved. Tests set the same switch
through `PptxMonstersGame(unlockAll: true)`.

Android, iOS and Windows are configured.

The game is **landscape only**. The layout is a 16:9 slide, letterboxed onto
whatever screen it gets, exactly the way a real deck behaves in slide show
mode. That is locked in three places, all of which are needed:

| Layer | Setting |
| --- | --- |
| Android | `android:screenOrientation="sensorLandscape"` on the activity, so even the launch theme cannot appear in portrait |
| iOS | `Info.plist` declares only the two landscape orientations, on phone and iPad |
| Dart | `Flame.device.setLandscape()` at startup, on mobile only |

`test/orientation_test.dart` guards all three, because re-running
`flutter create` regenerates the platform files from templates that allow
portrait.

On desktop the window stays freely resizable, as desktop windows should be; the
slide just letterboxes inside whatever shape it is given.

```bash
flutter test      # unit and layout tests
flutter analyze   # lints
```

CI runs both on every pull request, alongside debug builds for Android and
Windows — see [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml). The
workflow pins the Flutter version, so bump it together with `.metadata` when
upgrading the SDK.

To preview in a browser instead, add the web platform back with
`flutter create --platforms=web .`.

## How it is put together

```
lib/
  main.dart                  App shell; sets landscape, hosts the GameWidget
  game/
    pptx_monsters_game.dart  FlameGame + RouterComponent; one route per screen
    routes.dart              Route names
    levels.dart              The six slides, and the boss each one builds
    combat/impact.dart       Hit flashes, shakes and damage numbers, in one place
    deck.dart                Which slides are open, given what has been won
    slide/
      slide_metrics.dart     The 1280x720 design canvas and its margins
      slide_page.dart        Base page: scales and letterboxes the slide
      fly_in.dart            PowerPoint's entrance animation, as an extension
      focusable.dart         What keyboard and controller focus can land on
    input/                   Controller state, and keys and buttons as menu actions
    pages/                   One file per screen
    components/              Ribbon, status bar, placeholders, buttons, actors
    art/pptx_art.dart        Loads PNG frames exported from PowerPoint
    save/                    Progress kept between runs, as one JSON document
    theme/                   Colours and text styles, lifted from the Office UI
assets/images/               Exported artwork (see docs/)
```

Two conventions carry most of the weight:

**Everything is measured in slide units.** Layout code works against a fixed
1280×720 canvas and never sees device pixels; `SlidePage` handles the scaling
and centring. `test/slide_layout_test.dart` holds pages to that canvas.

**Artwork is optional.** `PptxActor` draws a procedural stand-in when its PNG
frames are missing, so the game runs before the art exists.

## Drawing the monsters

The art pipeline is PowerPoint itself — see
[docs/powerpoint-art-pipeline.md](docs/powerpoint-art-pipeline.md).
